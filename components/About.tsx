        About
      </h3>

      <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
        I focus on full-stack development with an emphasis on system-oriented
        thinking and real-world engineering constraints.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
        My work involves building applications end-to-end — from database schema
        design and authentication flows to frontend architecture and deployment.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
        I prioritize clarity, maintainability, and scalability over quick demos
        or surface-level features, preferring to design systems before
        implementing them in clean, readable code.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
        I care deeply about how software behaves in real-world conditions.
